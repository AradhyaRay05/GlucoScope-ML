# 🩺 GlucoScope-ML - AI-powered Diabetes Classification

---

## 🔍 Project Goal
GlucoScope-ML is designed to predict the **likelihood of diabetes** using **machine learning models**. It provides a robust framework for analyzing patient data and predicting diabetes outcomes based on key health metrics. The goal of this project is to leverage **data-driven insights** to assist in early diagnosis and better management of diabetes.

---

## 📖 Overview
The project utilizes a **real-world diabetes dataset** to train and evaluate machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. By integrating preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, GlucoScope-ML demonstrates how AI can contribute to healthcare advancements.

## 🔄 **Project Workflow**

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & EDA**
- **Data Inspection:** Loaded the dataset with Pandas for an initial inspection of its structure and types.  
- **EDA & Visualization:** Visualized feature distributions and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Replaced missing values in key columns (`Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`) with mean or median values.  
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardized the data range using `StandardScaler`.  
- **Train-Test Split:** Divided the processed data into training and testing sets for model validation.  

---

### **2️⃣ Model Building**
Tested and compared multiple models to find the best performer:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  

---

### **3️⃣ Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy:** The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of **98.75%** on the test set and **99.94%** on the training set.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualized to analyze the distribution of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.  
- **Classification Report:** Provided precision, recall, and F1-score for each class to evaluate model performance comprehensively.  
- **Cross-Validation:** Achieved an average accuracy of **95%** across 5 folds, ensuring model robustness.

## 🌐 **Deployment**

The project has been deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive web-based interface for real-time diabetes predictions. Users can input health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI to receive instant predictions.
